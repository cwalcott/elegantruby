My name is Ryan, and I'm a developer. I primarily code in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails framework,
though I always believe in choosing the right tool for the job (for instance, I'm a big fan of
Sinatra). I started this blog to include many of the miscellaneous tidbits I come across that help
me in my day-to-day work, and which I hope will help you.

I also split my time with iOS development (and I blog about it at [iOSDevNotes.com](http://www.iosdevnotes.com)).

### My Projects
I've written a lot of software over the years. Some of my current projects I'm most proud of:

* [PushLayer.com](http://www.pushlayer.com)

    As an iOS developer, many of my apps need to support push notifications. Dealing with the APNs,
    however, can be a frustrating undertaking. I helped create this site to make sending iOS push
    notifications easier for iOS developers.

* [iOSDevNotes.com](http://www.iosdevnotes.com)

    When I'm not blogging at ElegantRuby.com, I'm writing for iOSDevNotes.com, a site that's all
    about iOS development.

* [Invotrak.com](http://invotrak.com)

    A SaaS site I started years ago to help small business owners, freelancers, designers, and
    others create and track invoices and timesheets. The site was originally created to help with
    our [consulting business](http://www.draconis.com), and has since grown and become quite
    popular.

* [stately](http://www.github.com/rtwomey/stately)

    A Ruby gem to make state machines simple and elegant, stately allows you to define complex
    state machines in readable English, while keeping its implementation lean and minimalist.

### The Elegant Ruby Mailing List

I love writing elegant Ruby code, regardless of the framework. The language is inherently beautiful,
and I think the mark of a good programmer is someone who keeps his or her code _elegant_. To me,
elegant code is:

* Succinct but readable
* Correct but not overly defensive
* Self documenting
* Fast, but willing to make tradeoffs for the above goals

It's hard to write _elegant_ code, but my goal with this blog is to help illuminate the tools and
techniques I've used to do it. I've also created a mailing list to share additional information
with my subscribers, including info that isn't on this blog. You can subscribe here:
